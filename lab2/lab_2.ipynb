Przykładowo, 99% badanych jest zdrowych, a 1% ma niewykryty nowotwór - z oczywistych przyczyn chcemy wykrywać właśnie sytuację rzadką (problem diagnozy jako klasyfikacji jest zasadniczo zawsze niezbalansowany).

My natomiast chcemy zróżnicowania, żeby mieć niski bias - redukcją wariancji zajmuje się uśrednianie. Dlatego używa się metody losowej podprzestrzeni (random subspace method) - przy każdym podziale drzewa losuje się tylko pewien podzbiór cech, których możemy użyć do tego podziału.

O ile Random Forest trenował wszystkie klasyfikatory bazowe równolegle i je uśredniał, o tyle boosting robi to sekwencyjnie. Drzewa te uczą się na całym zbiorze, nie na próbkach boostrapowych. Idea jest następująca: trenujemy drzewo decyzyjne, radzi sobie przeciętnie i popełnia błędy na częsci przykładów treningowych. Dokładamy kolejne, ale znające błędy swojego poprzednika, dzięki czemu może to uwzględnić i je poprawić. W związku z tym \"boostuje\" się dzięki wiedzy od poprzednika.

Później wykorzystuje się spadek wzdłuż gradientu (gradient descent), aby nauczyć się, w jakim kierunku powinny optymalizować kolejne drzewa, żeby zminimalizować błędy poprzednika.

O ostatecznej decyzji decyduje model, który wykorzystuje te wartości cech. Powstaje pytanie - w jakim stopniu wartości cech przyczyniły się do wyniku swojej drużyny? Można to obliczyć jako wartości Shapleya (Shapley values), które dla modeli ML oblicza algorytm SHAP.
